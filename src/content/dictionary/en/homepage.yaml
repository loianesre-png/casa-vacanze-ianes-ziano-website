    - name: "Beppe"
      country: "Italy"
      text: "Lorenzo was much more than a host. He welcomed us as friends and assisted us with invaluable tourist and organizational suggestions, providing us with a well-kept property where absolutely nothing was missing. Always in touch with the utmost discretion and available for every need. A real added value to our vacation."
    - name: "Dietrich"
      country: "Germany"
      text: "It is very difficult to find an independent holiday home with a garden in a quiet location in the Dolomites – Lorenzo's house has these qualities. Also very sunny – compared to the densely built and often overcrowded villages in Val di Fassa. The kitchen is very well equipped. Lorenzo's attention to his guests is excellent. The price for these accommodation qualities is very reasonable."
    - name: "Sara"
      country: "Italy"
      text: "We had a wonderful time with our little one. The house was fully equipped and tidy. Super quiet location with a garden to relax or play. The town center is easily reachable on foot. Lorenzo was super helpful and gave us useful tips. Perfect house."
    - name: "Audrey"
      country: "Malta"
      text: "We really enjoyed our stay in Ziano. We traveled with two small children and the house was very comfortable for our family. It was a couple of minutes from the Latemar snowpark, ideal for kids. There's a supermarket just a few minutes' walk from the house. Lorenzo was very helpful and tried to accommodate us in every way. I will definitely visit the Dolomites again."
